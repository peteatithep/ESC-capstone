<ins>**Project Objectives**</ins>
- To study the working principles of an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC), Brushless DC (BLDC), and other components in an electric scooter.
- To design and develop an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) board and integrate it into an electric scooter prototype.
- To apply fundamentals of electrical engineering, such as power electronics, schematic design, microcontroller programming, and control systems, through the practical development and testing of the prototype.


<ins>**Scope of Work**</ins>
- Design and prototype the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) board for controlling a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor.
- Integrate the ESC prototype into an existing electric scooter for functional testing and demonstration.
- Develop firmware for BLDC motor control, including speed regulation, direction control, and a user interface for operation.
- Test, calibrate, and evaluate the performance of the ESC prototype under different operating conditions.
- Prepare project report and documentation.
